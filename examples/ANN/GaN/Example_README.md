# Example

## Before we start

We release this example (or manual) to help users to get a quick start on MLA project. Before getting started, you'd better know about some terms which are commonly used in machine learning. Make sure you can recognize them any time so that they won't get in the way of your study.

## Reference

As the name of the directory says,this example is totally based on neutral network. There were some crucial published papers which make it possible,both in theory and practice, for the low cost calculation of potential using neutral network scheme.

In this example, we use a well-tested implementation (called *ænet*)released in **[2]** as the neutral network scheme. The work flow of MLA and ænet are almost the same,thus it's also highly recommended to check out the detailed description in the released package of ænet. You can git it directly from Github.

## Work Flow

The most efficient way to have a quick start on open released projects is to follow its work flow completely. The work flow of MLA is different from other ML tasks in NLP(Natural Language Processing) or CV(Computer Vision). With the help of ab-initio molecular dynamics,we can get high-accuracy data files. Moreover,theory implies there must be a high correlation between structure and potential energy. So we just need to find out what the specific formula of it.  

### Step1   Build a reference dataset



### Step2   set up the environment
