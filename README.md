## Introduction

MLA(Machine Learning of Amorphous) project will collect and classify latest works with ML(Machine Learning) scheme on amorphous study,especially for the potential calculation .This project includes three main parts `collections`, `examples` and `tools` 

### Collections

In the directory named `collections` ,we collect main data sets,all important initialization files and well-tested results (which can be applied directly in molecular dynamics) for each subdirectory,in which captures one specific kind of materials (or models) and is respectively accompanied with a detailed README file like `GaN_README.md` 

As we expect this project can benifit further study on amorphous, there is a pressing need for more models,data sets,and new ideas or tools to improve the flexibility.Anyone interseted will be welcomed and you can post your message to 

>lhrong@csrc.ac.cn

### Examples

As a new-started project,we hope the collections can cover most interests.However,an common occurrence is for our collections to be not that perfect to meet your demands.Don't worry,we have extracted the main work flow from published papers to help you to build your own data sets.It's practical and reliable in our long-term tests.   
 
In the directory named `examples` ,we aim to show the complete work flow from very beginning.We wish you can get a quick start via the work flow.Besides,for some time-consuming and error-prone steps,some practical strategies are given.At present,only example on ANN(Artificial Neutral Network) scheme is released.If necessary, we may release more examples on other popular and open schemes such as GAP(Gaussian Approximation Potential) and SVM(Support Vector Machine).

You can get more information in `Example_README.md` 

### Tools

In the directory named `tools` ,there will be many efficient executable and scripts to help you to get rid of those tedious codes for some important but sophisticated steps in the training and selecting process.The call syntax and parameter description for each tool can be found in `Tool_README.md`
