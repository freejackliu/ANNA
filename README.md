# ANNA
## Introduction

ANNA(Artificial Neutral Network of Amorphous) will collect and classify latest works with NN(Neutral Network) scheme on amorphous study.This project includes three main parts `collections`, `examples` and `tools` 

### Collections

In the directory named `collections` , we collect main data sets,all important NN initialization files and well-tested results (which can be applied directly in molecular dynamics) for each subdirectory,in which captures one specific kind of materials (or models) and is accompanied with an individual detailed README file like `GaN_README.md`

As a new-started project,we hope the collections can cover most interests.However,an common occurrence is for our collections to be not that perfect to meet your demands.Don't worry,we have extracted main work flow from published papers.
