# ANNA
## Introduction

ANNA(Artificial Neutral Network of Amorphous) will collect and classify latest works with NN(Neutral Network) scheme on amorphous study,especially for the potential calculation .This project includes three main parts `collections`, `examples` and `tools` 

### Collections

In the directory named `collections` , we collect main data sets,all important NN initialization files and well-tested results (which can be applied directly in molecular dynamics) for each subdirectory,in which captures one specific kind of materials (or models) and is respectively accompanied with a detailed README file like `GaN_README.md` 

As we expect this project can benifit further study on amorphous, there is a pressing need for more models,data sets,and new ideas or tools to improve the flexibility.Anyone interseted will be welcomed and you can post your message to 

>lhrong@csrc.ac.cn

### Examples

As a new-started project,we hope the collections can cover most interests.However,an common occurrence is for our collections to be not that perfect to meet your demands.Don't worry,we have extracted the main work flow from published papers to help you building your own data sets.It's practical and reliable in our long-term tests.
